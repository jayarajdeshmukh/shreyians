    1. var 
    Old way of declaring variables.
    Scope: Function-scoped (available inside the whole function, not just inside a block).
    Problem: Can be redeclared and updated, which sometimes causes bugs.

   2. let
      Modern way of declaring variables (introduced in ES6).
      Scope: Block-scoped (only works inside { }).
      Can update, but cannot redeclare in the same block.

   3. const
      Also modern of declaring variables (ES6).
      Scope: Block-scoped.
      Cannot redeclare and cannot update the value.
