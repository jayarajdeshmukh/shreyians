    <!-- Event Loop
    JavaScript is single-threaded → it can run one task at a time.
    first run syncronus code after code run asynchronus code 

     synchronous = code runs line by line
     Asynchronous = Code does not wait for the slow task. (setTimeout, setInterval, API calls, events)

    -->

     <!-- What is setTimeout?
=> used to run a piece of code after a specified delay (in milliseconds) -->

    <!-- What is setInterval
     => repeat a code again and again after specified delay  
    -->

    <!-- MAP :
       creates a new array by applying a callback function to each element of the original array.
       It does not modify the original array 
    -->

    <!-- Reduce
      reduce() reduces an array to a single value.
    -->

    <!-- Closures
      Ek function jo return karta hai ek aur function, aur return hone wala function hamesha use karega parent function ka koi variable
       A function inside another fnc that can still use parent fnc variables, even after parent fnc has finished running

    <!-- Lexical Scopping
      fnc inside fnc inside fnc
      fnc can access only inside curly braces{}
     -->

     <!-- Events
      We use events to make webpages interactive. like clicking button, hovering mouse, typing in a textbox
